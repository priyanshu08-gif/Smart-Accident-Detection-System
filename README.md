**Smart Accident Detection System**
An intelligent accident detection and alert system that automatically identifies road accidents in real time and instantly sends emergency alerts with live GPS location to ensure faster medical response and improved road safety.
**Problem Statement**
Road accidents often result in severe injuries or fatalities due to delayed emergency response. In many cases, victims are unable to call for help, and accidents remain unnoticed for critical minutes. Existing systems rely heavily on manual reporting, which is unreliable and time-consuming.
**Proposed Solution**
The Smart Accident Detection System automatically detects accidents using sensor data and intelligent logic. Once an accident is identified, the system immediately sends alerts along with the exact location to emergency contacts and medical services, reducing response time and potentially saving lives.
**System Architecture**
The system consists of:
1.Motion and impact sensors for accident detection
2.A microcontroller or mobile device for data processing
3.GPS module for location tracking
4.Cloud server for data handling
5.Web application for visualization and alerts
**Working Methodology**
1.Sensors continuously monitor vehicle motion
2.Sudden impact or abnormal movement is detected
3.Accident severity is evaluated
4.GPS captures real-time location
5.Alert is sent to emergency services and contacts
**Software:**
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js / Python
Database: Firebase / MongoDB
APIs: Maps API, SMS / Email Alert API
